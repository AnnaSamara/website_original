One previous study provides direct evidence for this process: Samara and Caravolas (2014) demonstrated that 7-year-olds generalize over permissible letter contexts (graphotactics) in novel word-like stimuli under incidental learning conditions. However, unlike in actual orthography, conditioning contexts in Samara and Caravolas’ (2014) stimuli comprised perfectly correlated, redundant cues in both word-initial and word-final positions. The current study explores whether 7-year-olds can extract such constraints in the absence of redundant cues. Since theories of literacy development predict greater sensitivity to restrictions within word-final units, we also contrast learning in word-initial and word-final units. We demonstrate that–for 7-year-old learners in two linguistic contexts (English and Turkish)–there is substantial evidence for the learning of both types of restriction.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical learning and spelling: Evidence from an incidental learning experiment with children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Helen Brown","Kenny Smith","**Anna Samara**","Elizabeth Wonnacott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"90b271df0d81946f05798b1df447bd9f","permalink":"/publication/jml_under-review/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jml_under-review/","section":"publication","summary":"Grammatical categories correlate with semantics cues; however, semantic cues seem to pose difficulties for child learners. We explore whether 6-year-olds and adults generalize over semantic cues, and how this is affected by the extent of exposure (1v4 sessions) and the number of exemplars for each semantic class (type-frequency). Participants were exposed to semi-artificial languages in which nouns co-occurred with novel particles, with particle usage either fully or partially determined by a semantic property of the noun. Subsequent production and comprehension tests showed that both adults and children generalized semantic cues to novel nouns when cues were fully consistent. Adults (but not children) also generalized when cues were partially consistent. However, although generalization increased with exposure, there was no evidence for a role of type-frequency (i.e. no greater generalization when there were more nouns per category). In addition, post-experiment interviews suggested that successful generalization was dependent upon explicit awareness. These results suggest that the usage of semantic cues in first language acquisition may be limited in children.","tags":null,"title":"Semantic cues in language learning: An artificial language study with adult and child learners","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536447600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536447600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Daniela Singh","Anna Samara","Elizabeth Wonnacott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529928000,"objectID":"1423bbfda4c2807add3f4b9fbb084731","permalink":"/talk/daniela/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/daniela/","section":"talk","summary":"A recent poster presentation on our ongoing work on implicit vs. explicit learning of purely visual orthographic constraints.

While the existence of this kind of socially conditioned variation is well-established, less is known about how it is acquired. Studies of naturalistic language use by children provide various examples where children’s production of sociolinguistic variants appears to be conditioned on similar factors to adults’ production, but it is difficult to determine whether this reflects knowledge of sociolinguistic conditioning or systematic differences in the input to children from different social groups. Furthermore, artificial language learning experiments have shown that children have a tendency to eliminate variation, a process which could potentially work against their acquisition of sociolinguistic variation. The current study used a semi-artificial language learning paradigm to investigate learning of the sociolinguistic cue of speaker identity in 6-year-olds and adults. Participants were trained and tested on an artificial language where nouns were obligatorily followed by one of two meaningless particles and were produced by one of two speakers (one male, one female). Particle usage was conditioned deterministically on speaker identity (Experiment 1), probabilistically (Experiment 2), or not at all (Experiment 3). Participants were given tests of production and comprehension. In Experiments 1 and 2, both children and adults successfully acquired the speaker identity cue, although the effect was stronger for adults and in Experiment 1. In addition, in all three experiments, there was evidence of regularization in participants’ productions, although the type of regularization differed with age: children showed regularization by boosting the frequency of one particle at the expense of the other, while adults regularized by conditioning particle usage on lexical items. Overall, results demonstrate that children and adults are sensitive to speaker identity cues, an ability which is fundamental to tracking sociolinguistic variation, and that children’s well-established tendency to regularize does not prevent them from learning sociolinguistically conditioned variation.","tags":null,"title":"Acquiring variation in an artificial language: Children and adults are sensitive to socially conditioned linguistic variation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kenny Smith","Amy Perfors","Olga Feher","**Anna Samara**","Kate Swoboda","Elizabeth Wonnacott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483574400,"objectID":"83b2a5969a7c9dfb569c2e8a789e7e48","permalink":"/publication/transactions_paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/transactions_paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Linguistic universals arise from the interaction between the processes of language learning and language use. A test case for the relationship between these factors is linguistic variation, which tends to be conditioned on linguistic or sociolinguistic criteria. How can we explain the scarcity of unpredictable variation in natural language, and to what extent is this property of language a straightforward reflection of biases in statistical learning? We review three strands of experimental work exploring these questions, and introduce a Bayesian model of the learning and transmission of linguistic variation along with a closely matched artificial language learning experiment with adult participants. Our results show that while the biases of language learners can potentially play a role in shaping linguistic systems, the relationship between biases of learners and the structure of languages is not straightforward. Weak biases can have strong effects on language structure as they accumulate over repeated transmission. But the opposite can also be true: strong biases can have weak or no effects. Furthermore, the use of language during interaction can reshape linguistic systems. Combining data and insights from studies of learning, transmission and use is therefore essential if we are to understand how biases in statistical learning interact with language transmission and language use to shape the structural properties of language.This article is part of the themed issue 'New frontiers for statistical learning in the cognitive sciences'.","tags":null,"title":"Language learning, language use, and the evolution of linguistic variation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Samara"],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.

An artificial grammar learning paradigm served to assess dyslexic and typical readers’ ability to exploit information about chunk frequency, letter-position patterns, and specific string similarity, all of which have analogous constructs in real orthographies. We also investigated whether implicit learning deficits in dyslexia held for letter strings (Experiment 1) and symbol strings (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 results indicated that dyslexic adults were mildly impaired in memorizing letter strings, although this finding proved inconclusive in a more stringent analysis of the data across experiments. There were no signs of difficulty during symbol string memorization in Experiment 2. In each experiment, dyslexic and nondyslexic readers were comparably sensitive to chunk frequencies and showed reliable sensitivity to letter and shape position patterns and string similarities.

In the present chapter we review the research carried out in different writing systems to assess the extent to which this triple foundation provides a good language-general model of early literacy development. The evidence is considered in the context of potentially important moderating, language-specific influences of orthographic variables, especially symbol-sound mapping consistency. We propose that the triple foundation model, conceptualized as (1) knowledge of the functional symbol set of the orthography, (2) awareness of the speech units to which orthographic symbols map, and (3) efficient mappings between the representational systems of orthographic symbols and their related speech units provides a universally valid description of the cognitive architecture underlying early literacy development","tags":null,"title":"Learning to Read and Spell Words in Different Writing Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Anna Samara**","Marketa Caravolas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"32d08afdddece4fd8e68a51a751aba53","permalink":"/publication/2014-paper/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study explored statistical learning processes in the acquisition of orthographic knowledge in school-aged children and skilled adults.

Following incidental exposure to pattern-embedding stimuli in Phase 1, participants’ learning generalization was tested in Phase 2 with legality judgments about novel conforming/nonconforming word-like strings. Test phase performance was above chance, suggesting that both types of constraints were reliably learned even after relatively brief exposure. As hypothesized, signal detection theory d′ analyses confirmed that learning permissible letter positions (d′ = 0.97) was easier than permissible neighboring letter contexts (d′ = 0.19).

So far, we have shown that (i) 5-year-olds can indeed track the gender cue (without being explicitly told to look for a cue) from languages featuring either one male/female speaker or multiple male/female speakers and (ii) that they use the cue correctly to guess what boys/girls would have said (Samara, Smith, Brown, \u0026amp; Wonnacott, 2017).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2ca24fea52b39021ce9e7779846c4d7e","permalink":"/project/internal-project3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project3/","section":"project","summary":"ALL work","tags":[],"title":"Learning patterns of language usage","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Spelling is a complex and challenging task, particularly in orthographies where letters and sounds do not have one-to-one correspondence (e.g., in English, vowel sounds can be spelled in as many as five different ways). In line with increasing evidence that memorization and explicit learning skills do not suffice for competent spelling skill to develop, I have been investigating spellers’ frequency-based sensitivity: For example, can beginner spellers pick up on untaught orthographic conventions (e.g. gz and dz are illegal spellings of frequent word-final sound combinations in English; *bagz, *padz) from simple text exposure and what are the computational mechanisms at play? I address these questions using artificial lexicons, i.e., novel words which exemplify spelling patterns akin to those seen in natural orthographies. Using these methods, I have shown that frequency statistics do have an influence on children’s spelling preferences: For example, beginning spellers rapidly learn and generalize over novel orthographic conventions for permissible letter contexts (e.g., d and o cannot occur next to one another) (Samara \u0026amp; Caravolas, 2014) both when these are embedded within rime units (i.e., vowel-plus-final-consonant units) and body units (i.e., initial consonant plus-vowel units) (Samara, Singh, \u0026amp; Wonnacott, 2018).
