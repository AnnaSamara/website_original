Spelling is a complex and challenging task, particularly in orthographies where letters and sounds do not have one-to-one correspondence (e.g., in English, vowel sounds can be spelled in as many as five different ways). In line with increasing evidence that memorization and explicit learning skills do not suffice for competent spelling skill to develop, I have been investigating spellers’ frequency-based sensitivity: For example, can beginner spellers pick up on untaught orthographic conventions (e.g. gz and dz are illegal spellings of frequent word-final sound combinations in English; *bagz, *padz) from simple text exposure and what are the computational mechanisms at play? I address these questions using artificial lexicons, i.e., novel words which exemplify spelling patterns akin to those seen in natural orthographies. Using these methods, I have shown that frequency statistics do have an influence on children’s spelling preferences: For example, beginning spellers rapidly learn and generalize over novel orthographic conventions for permissible letter contexts (e.g., d and o cannot occur next to one another) (Samara & Caravolas, 2014) both when these are embedded within rime units (i.e., vowel-plus-final-consonant units) and body units (i.e., initial consonant plus-vowel units) (Samara, Singh, & Wonnacott, 2018). Other ongoing work with collaborators Elizabeth Wonnacott and Daniela Singh compares children’s and adults' ability to learn other useful statistical patterns (e.g., purely visual or graphotactic constraints on double letters); explores the longevity of lab-induced orthographic learning; and compares orthographic learning under explicit and implicit instructions.
