I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Language Learning lab] (https://languagelearninglab-ucl.com/), UCL. Currently, I work on the ERC funded project, awarded to Professor Ben Ambridge (University of Liverpool), that investigates the retreat from overgeneralization in child language acquisition.
