I am a Lecturer in Psychology at the School of Human Sciences, Greenwich University. I am interested in literacy and language development and use artificial learning methods to explore questions about how children learn aspects of written and spoken language. I am also interested in the underlying causes of literacy impairment, e.g., developmental dyslexia.


  *Short bio:* I completed my PhD in Psychology in 2014 at Bangor University, UK. My doctoral research, funded by a Marie Curie ITN initiative, investigated children’s and adults incidental learning’ of probabilistic relationships within and between sounds and letter combinations. Before joining the University of Greenwich (09.2019), I worked as a postdoctoral Research Associate at UCL (2014-2017) and Liverpool University (2017-2019) on projects that investigate children’s ability to extract statistical patterns from spoken input. I continue some of this work by carrying out research on children's sociolinguistic development.
