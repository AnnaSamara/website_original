I am a Lecturer (Teaching) based in [UCL's Division of Psychology and Language Sciences] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/). I study literacy and language acquisition processes using [artificial language learning methods] (https://anna-samara.netlify.app/ALL-Samara.pdf), that is, experiments whereby children and adults learn experimenter designed miniatures languages. One central strand of this work investigates how children learn probabilistic relationships between sound and letter combinations via statistical learning processes. I am also interested in how these processes contribute to dyslexia and sociolinguistic development.  


Short bio: I completed my PhD in Psychology at Bangor University, UK in 2014. My doctoral research was funded by a Marie Curie [Initial Training Network initiative] (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/215961/reporting). Before joining the University of Greenwich in August 2019, I worked as a postdoctoral Research Associate at UCL (2014-2017) and the University of Liverpool (2017-2019) on externally funded projects on language. I continue some of this work with [collaborators at Oxford University] (https://languagelearninglab-ox.com/).
