I am a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the School of Human Sciences, Greenwich University. In my research, I study literacy and language acquisition processes using artificial language learning methods, that is experiments whereby children and adults learning experimenter designed miniatures language. One central strand of this work investigates how children learn probabilistic relationships between sound and letter combinations. I am also interested in the underlying causes of developmental dyslexia and sociolinguistic development.


  *Short bio:* I completed my PhD in Psychology in 2014 at Bangor University, UK. My doctoral research, funded by a Marie Curie ITN initiative, investigated children’s and adults incidental learning’ of probabilistic relationships within and between sounds and letter combinations. Before joining the University of Greenwich in August 2019, I worked as a postdoctoral Research Associate at UCL (2014-2017) and the University of Liverpool (2017-2019) on projects that investigate children’s ability to extract statistical patterns from spoken input. I continue some of this work by carrying out research on children's sociolinguistic development.
